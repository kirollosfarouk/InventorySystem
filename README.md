# InventorySystem

This was an Optimization Test Task for interview process:

- I add the needed variables for the infoPanel and made them update when the selected item changed it was a straight forward process.
- For the High number for patches required to draw the icons for the list I moved all the icons into a sprite sheet.
- For the lag when scrolling I have created a pooling system to reuse item object instead of creating new ones.
